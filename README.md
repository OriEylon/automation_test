# automation_test
this is my REST API implementation and E2E tests on a small db that i created solely for these tests & API.
API includes classic CRUD requests.
server runs from API file.
i wrote this API using flask & sqlalchemy so these libraries are required for the app to run.
wrote the test cases using requests lib.
tested through pytest
